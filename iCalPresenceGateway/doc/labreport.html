<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Gateway that generates SIP presence events based on iCal calendar information, allowing for automated busy tracking.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Provide a brief introduction to what you have done and lay out the
organization of the remainder of the report, with hyperlinks to each
section.

<p>Citations should be of the form:
<blockquote>
In earlier work <a href="#1">[1]</a>, we showed that HTML is a Turing
machine.

</blockquote>

<p>Each paragraph should start with
<pre>
   &lt;p>
</pre>
and paragraphs should be separated by a blank line. For easier editing
and source viewing, lines should be folded to 72 characters.

<p>You may use all of the HTML 3.2 or HTML 4.0 elements, including
tables.  Avoid frames and aninmated GIF lines for the report. Do
<em>not</em> use Microsoft Word to generate HTML, as the output is only
viewable on Microsoft browsers. If you need to use an HTML editor,
consider Netscape or Frontpage.

<p>For ease of printing, the report should be a single HTML file, with
all images in the same directory.

<h2><a name="related_work">Related Work</a></h2>

<p>Who else has been doing something similar and how your effort is
different.


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Provide background on the subject and components.  The title of
this section is likely to differ from project to project and you may
have several of these sections.

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>If applicable to your project, give an overview of the architecture
of the software, i.e., which modules do what. Justify the overall
architecture and briefly discuss alternatives, if you have considered
(and discarded) them. From your description, a reader should be able
to understand what the various components do and which one would need
to be modified to extend the software's functionality. Also indicate the
rough complexity (in lines of code) and language used.

<h2>Program Documentation</h2>

<p>Please refer to <a href=install.html>this page</a> for detailed information about:

<ul>
<li>System Requirements, (OS, hardware specs, et al.)
<li>Gateway installation and configuration
<li>Quick-Start guide to running
<li>Detailed explanation of list of configuration file parameters and running
</ul>

<p>In addition, the <a href=install.html>install</a> page covers:

<ul>
<li>Gateway internal design
<li>Gateway and problem domain limitations
<li>Future work and enhancements
</ul>

<p>Note: Do not use JPEG for screen dumps, as they will make the writing
illegible. Use GIF or PNG.

<p>This part is meant to be part of the program documentation, while
parts of this document might become a technical report or a conference
paper.

<h2><a name="measurements">Measurements</a></h2>

<p>Where applicable, this describes any measurements or tests conducted.

<h2>Task List</h2>

<p>This describes who did what and what was copied from somewhere else.
